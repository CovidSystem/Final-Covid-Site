Nonessential Workers, the Unemployed, and Students
</font><BR>

 <div style="width:700px; margin:0 auto;">
<p>
Many nonessential workers have been able to work remotely from home, in order to adhere to state closure laws.
<BR>
Meanwhile, the federal government issued unemployment check to those whose jobs are not essential and cannot be done remotely. 
<BR>
Lastly, students and those who do not qualify for unemployment spend their time during the pandemic trying to stay as busy as possible within their homes.
<BR>
Activities include but are not limited to: watching Netflix, reading, baking a lot of bread for some reason, and a lot of social media.
