	<p align="center"> <br> In the third possible future, the current wave creates a new normal, with Covid-19 outbreaks of nearly equal size and,<br>
	in most cases, duration through the end of 2022. At that point, the best-case scenario is that<br> 
	an effective vaccine has arrived; if not, then the world experiences Covid-19 until<br>
	at least half of the population has been infected, with or without becoming ill.<br>

	"Do the endless waves mean that social distancing will have to be reimposed over and over, forcing the repeated closures of  <br>
	businesses that just reopened and the laying off of employees whose jobs keep being eliminated?<br>
	Although it's hard to remember, the stay-at-home orders, business shutdowns,<br>
	and other mitigation measures were all in service of flattening the curve: slowing the spread of Covid-19,<br>
	enough to keep the number of patients needing hospitalization,<br>
	intensive care, or a ventilator no greater than the health system's capacity. <br>
	Flattening the curve did not mean zero cases and deaths, or even a few thousand."<br>
