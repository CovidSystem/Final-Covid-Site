	<p align="center"> <br> In the second scenario, the current monster wave is followed later this year by one twice as fierce and even longer-lasting,<br>
	as the outbreak rebounds after a summer when a significant drop in the number of cases and deaths led officials and individuals to let down their guard,<br> 
	relax physical distancing more than was safe, and fail to heed (or even detect) the early warning signs that a new outbreak was gathering force.<br>
	After this doubly disastrous second wave, the sea is almost calm, marred only by an occasional wave of cases that number barely one-fifth of what the fall and spring of 2020 saw.<br>

	An imminent or actual crash of the health care system, similar to what northern Italy experienced in March, <br>
	would force national, state, and local officials to impose mitigation measures even stricter than those of the last six weeks,<br>
	which - as happened in China from late January to early March - would mostly snuff out Covid-19.
