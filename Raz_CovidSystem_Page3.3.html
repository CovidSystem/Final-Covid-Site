Government Orders
 </font><BR>

<div>
<p>

The President holds press conferences to inform the public and for media outlets to ask clarifying questions.
<BR><BR>
- In these conferences, the President is accompanied by members of the pandemic preparedness plan committee.
<BR>
- In our current pandemic, this is the Coronavirus Task Force.
<BR>
- A very important member of this task force is Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
<BR>
- While the President relays what information he has been given, Dr. Fauci explains the medical research behind what is going on.

<p>


News outlets are a very popular platform for people to get up ot date information on the pandemic.
<BR><BR>
- As shown in the photograph, not all news platforms are the same.
<BR>
- Ratings and opinions vary between the different news outlets.
<BR>
- While some news outlets may focus on just federal orders, others invite guests who specialize in different departments to help views better navigate this pandemic.

Social Media
</font><BR>

 <div style="float:right;width:650px;">
<p>
Social media has been one of the largest sources for information asit is also unfortunately the President's preferred form of communication.
<BR><BR>
- While social media has the ability to reach wider audiences than other forms of communication, this also comes with a downside: misinformation.
<BR>
- Since anyone can post anything about the pandemic online, when false information is put out, it is often spread without much fact-checking.
<BR>
- In turn this can create mass reactions and stress, and in the case where the public was told not to wear masks if you are not personally infected, it can hold back efforts to stop the spread of the virus.
