The Government on both Federal and State levels work to <b>inform the public</b><BR>

 Federal Responsibilities</font><BR>
 


<div>
<p>
The federal government is in charge of the following: 
<BR><BR>
- Interstate travel
<BR><BR>
- Virus-spread risks (Example: the CDC has the power to invoke quarantine)
<BR><BR>
- Coordinating supplies such as personal protective equipment and ventilators to ensure that states are not <i>competing</i> for these supplies.

State Responsibilities
</font><BR>

 <div style="width:700px; margin:0 auto;">
<p>
<BR>
States have more power within stat-at-home orders and business closures.
<BR><BR>
- States can also serve as "lab rats" for trying out what does and doesn't work abut the pandemic preparedness plan on the large scale.
<BR><BR>
- States also have the authorities to public health emergency and police powers.

Where They Clash
</font>

 <div style="float:right;width:650px;">
<p>
One of the biggest clashes between federal and state government that is expressed during a pandemic has to do with response infrastructure and public health surveillance.
<BR><BR>
- While the federal government is responsible for devising a plan and surveilling the overall changes in public health as the plan proves effective or ineffective,
<BR>
- Actual decisions about what remains open or closed is decided at the state level.
<BR>
- This has proved to be a problem in our current pandemic, states such as North and South Dakota, Wyoming, Iowa, Utah, and Nebraska had no Stay-at-Home orders as last as mid April. 
<BR>
- Their governments rely on voluntary compliance with the CDC's orders
